The Black-winged Kite is quite common in the open areas around Pune. I see this
pretty delightful bird on the electric cables alongside the roads, or
hovering over open areas, hill slopes, scanning for any rodent, lizard or even
grasshoppers. But, I realized that over so many years I hadn't heard it giving any
kind of call. It is a pretty quiet bird, hardly giving a squeak.


So, I decided to check online to see if there were any recordings of it's calls.
As expected there were not many but people had indeed recorded it's calls.


Again skimming through the field guides confirmed that I haven't been observant enough.

Rassmussen

Calls include thin, peeping whistles and screeches; whistle types given in
series from perch include a clear strongly upslurred /*fwIT!, fwIT!*/... (pitch
2-4KHz, note 0.15s, 1 note/s; Africa-CC), the series rising slightly in pitch
and strength;

a slightly upslurred, nearly disyllabic *pWEeIP,/pWEIP* ...(pitch 2.5-3KHz)

The birds of the world website explains that the vocalizations are given most
frequently in courtship and around nest. That's probably the reason why most
birders would never get to hear it unless they are witness to their courtship or
nesting behavior. Mental note: got to see this sometime soon.
